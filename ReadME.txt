Aperture is a minimal PHP album with a built in CMS for simplified usage. Aperture was built in an hour for a friend of mine and later on I decided to make it public.

Requirements
- PHP 5.x with Mysqli extension
- MySQL Server

Installation
- Copy all files to your server
- Make the folders admin/uploads and admin/thumbs writeable (chmod 777)
- Import DB.sql to a database on your server using PhpMyAdmin or similar
- Edit admin/CONFIG.php to reflect your server details
- Change Username and Password for security reasons
- DONE!
